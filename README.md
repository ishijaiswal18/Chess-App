# ♟️ ChessApp: Master the Board

Welcome to ChessApp, where strategy meets Python magic! This chess engine is not just about moves; it's about unleashing the power of negamax, alpha-beta pruning, and even a touch of grandmaster wisdom. Let's dive into the world of checkmates and smart chess moves! 🚀🔥

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Board Evaluation Magic 🎩
We've summoned the power of Python-chess for move generation and confirmation. But wait, there's more! Our board evaluation involves piece square tables, where each piece's position has a magical value. It's like chess, but with a touch of wizardry. ♟️✨

### Negamax and Alpha-Beta Pruning Spell 🔮
To predict our next moves, we've employed the magical negamax version of the minimax algorithm. It's a dance where one player's loss equals another's gain. To speed things up, we've added a touch of alpha-beta pruning magic, stopping us from considering every single possibility and only exploring the most promising paths. 🧙‍♂️💫

### Smartness Overload with Book Moves 📚
Our chess engine is not just smart; it's genius! We've incorporated initial moves from the chess grandmasters' playbook to make our engine think ahead. It's like having a grandmaster whispering moves in your ear. 📖🔍

### Quiescence Search: Calming the Tactical Storm 🌪️
To avoid the chaos of unreliable evaluations, we've added a quiescence search. It's like a tranquil retreat at the end of our search, focusing on capturing moves and maintaining the stability of our evaluations. Because in chess, calm minds make the best moves. ☯️♛
